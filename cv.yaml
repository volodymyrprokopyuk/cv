achievements:
  - project: Unified payment data store
    logo: image/logo-icon.png
    STAR:
      - >
        *Situation*: an **instant payments product** connects to **multiple
        payment schemes** e. g. **SEPA**, **STEP1**, **STEP2**, **RT1**,
        **TIPS**. *Before the change*: each payment scheme had its own
        **scheme-specific payment processing view** (operational dashboard). A
        payment operator **had to consult multiple systems** during a payment
        investigation or a manual payment repair
      - >
        *Task*: provide a **unified view on payment processing** under different
        payment schemes, allow **enrichment of standard payment messages** with
        customer-specific data while being **compliant with ISO 20022**
      - >
        *Action*: design and implement a **generic relational data model** that
        allows **arbitrary typed connections** between standard payment messages
        including non-standard customer-specific data payloads
      - >
        *Result*: **improved customer satisfaction** with a **unified view on
        payment processing** across multiple payment schemes, a scalable
        **system-wide transaction log**, **single source of truth** for payment
        operations, real-time payment monitoring, and payment analytics
  - project: Stable FX pricing and execution
    logo: image/logo-santander.png
    auxLogo: image/logo-pagofx.jpg
    STAR:
      - >
        *Situation*: a **cross-border payment service** provides **very
        competitive real-time FX rates** available to a big bank. However, FX
        rates are quite volatile and **change frequently**. *Before the change*:
        a real-time FX rate was provided for an initial quote, then an **updated
        real-time FX rate was silently applied** to an instructed payment which
        was totally unexpected to customers. This quickly transformed into a
        **negative feedback** and an **increased abandonment rate**
      - >
        *Task*: offer to customers a **stable FX pricing** for the duration (15
        mins) of their payment journey from the initial quoting and payment
        funding through the beneficiary screening and risk assessment to the
        payment routing and payment execution. The **company absorbed FX loss or
        gain** due to volatility of FX pricing
      - >
        *Action*: design and implement a **stable FX pricing for 15 mins** with
        a **notification** of a customer about a **new FX quote** after 15 mins
        if a payment was not yet instructed
      - >
        *Result*: **improved customer satisfaction** and **higher usage of the
        payment service** due to elimination of unexpected changes of FX pricing
        during a payment journey
  - project: Automated digital identity verification
    logo: image/logo-santander.png
    auxLogo: image/logo-pagofx.jpg
    STAR:
      - >
        *Situation*: a **cross-border payment service** provides payment
        services to a big number of **customers in multiple countries** (UK,
        Spain, Belgium). *Before the change*: a **semi-manual process for
        customer onboarding** with manual validation of every new customer. A
        customer onboarding was finished and the **account activated only after
        a manual check**. **Periodic check was not feasible** for manual
        processing given a big number of customers
      - >
        *Task*: design a **seamless and instant customer onboarding**,
        **automatically collect and verify customer personal data**, enough to
        support AML and fraud checks from the KYC perspective. Ensure **seamless
        periodic checks of customer personal data** to stay compliant with
        regulations
      - >
        *Action*: design and implement **integrations with country-specific
        providers of digital identity verification** (capture of a national ID
        or a driver license, matching a selfie with the ID card, a liveness
        probe) to support a **fully automated instant onboarding of low risk
        customer profiles**
      - >
        *Result*: **improved customer satisfaction**, **increased a
        lead-to-customer conversion**, **decreased abandonment rate** due to a
        **frictionless fully automated instant customer onboarding** through a
        digital identity verification as well as periodic checks of customer
        personal data
