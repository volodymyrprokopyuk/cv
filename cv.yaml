        A guided blockchain from scratch in Go with gRPC
        <a href="https://github.com/volodymyrprokopyuk/go-blockchain"
        target="_blank" class="link font-medium">
        https://github.com/volodymyrprokopyuk/go-blockchain</a>
      - >
        Designed, implemented, tested, and documented a **complete blockchain
        from scratch in Go using gRPC** as the inter-node communication
        protocol. The blockchain manages accounts using the **Secp256k1 elliptic
        curve key pairs** and the **AES-GCM encryption** with the **Argon2
        KDF**. The blockchain verifies transactions and creates blocks using the
        **ECDSA Secp256k1 digital signatures** and the **Keccak256 hash
        function**. The blockchain employs the **Merkle proof** to prove the
        inclusion of transactions into blocks, and verify the integrity of
        transactions on the blockchain. The blockchain implements the
        **concurrency safe peer discovery** mechanism in the **peer-to-peer
        blockchain network**. The **concurrency safe transaction relay** and the
        **block relay mechanisms** ensure the resilient propagation of
        transactions through the peer-to-peer network, and the synchronization
        of the blockchain state on each node using the **Go channel composition
        and multiplexing**, and the **gRPC server and client streaming**. The
        **blockchain state** manages the lifecycle of transactions and blocks in
        the concurrency safe way using the **Go mutexes and channels**. The
        blockchain implements the **Proof of Authority consensus**. The
        **concurrency safe blockchain node event streaming** concurrently
        delivers blockchain domain events in real-time to subscribed clients
        using the **Go concurrency primitives** and the **gRPC server
        streaming**. The blockchain provides the **CLI over the gRPC** to have
        complete control of the blockchain from the command line. The **140-page
        guide** fully documents the blockchain design and implementation. The
        guide explains the theoretical foundations, and provides the practical
        testing and usage examples, invaluable for **effective learning of the
        blockchain concepts**, and **progressive building of the blockchain from
        scratch in Go**

        A guided BIP-32 HD wallet with BIP-39 mnemonics in Go and Nushell
        <a href="https://github.com/volodymyrprokopyuk/go-wallet"
        target="_blank" class="link font-medium">
        https://github.com/volodymyrprokopyuk/go-wallet</a>
      - >
        Designed, implemented, tested, and documented a **BIP-32 HD wallet**
        with **BIP-39 mnemonics** in Go using Nushell for integration testing of
        the provided CLI tools. The wallet CLI exposes convenient tools for
        generating and deriving BIP-39 mnemonics, deriving BIP-32 HD wallet
        extended public and private keys, generating and deriving **secp256k1
        key pairs**, generating and verifying **ECDSA signatures**, **ERC-55
        encoding of Ethereum addresses**, encoding and converting derived keys
        into different formats. The modular design of the wallet CLI tools and
        the underlying Go library functions allows for easy composition of
        cryptographic primitives and standard-defined HD wallet operations to be
        combined in flexible ways, which is invaluable for learning and
        experimentation
  - project: Federated IAM for instant payment processing
    logo: image/logo-icon.png
    STAR:
      - >
        *Situation*: an **instant payments product** provides reliable and
        efficient **connectors to different payment schemes** along with a
        **unified payment data store** that is the single source of truth for
        all payment processing. *Before the change*: all access to the payment
        connectors and the payment data store was managed through **manually
        provisioned generic accounts** reused by client bank operators and bank
        systems
      - >
        *Task*: design and implement a **federated IAM solution** that securely
        manages access of client bank operators and bank systems to applications
        and APIs of the instant payments product. The IAM solution should
        support **federated identity management** and provide **fine-grained
        access control mechanisms** with corresponding **security monitoring and
        access audit functions** for client bank administrators
      - >
        *Action*: a standard-compliant, reliable, and scalable IAM solution
        **delegates the initial authentication** of principals to the bank
        federated identity provider, as well as supports the **adaptive
        authentication with MFA** by requesting additional authentication
        factors before granting access to sensitive payment information and
        critical operations. The IAM solution features **dynamic, flexible, and
        fine-grained PBAC** fully managed by client bank administrators
      - >
        *Result*: the standard-compliant IAM solution provides **secure and
        compliant access** of client bank operators and bank systems to the
        instant payment product applications and APIs. The IAM solution directly
        contributes to **faster time-to-value**, **reduced operational costs**,
        and **increased customer trust** by seamless integration with the
        **bank-managed federated identity provider**, and **dynamic and flexible
        access policies** fully controlled by the client bank administrators
  - project: Unified payment data store
    logo: image/logo-icon.png
    STAR:
      - >
        *Situation*: an **instant payments product** connects to **multiple
        payment schemes** e. g. **SEPA**, **STEP1**, **STEP2**, **RT1**,
        **TIPS**. *Before the change*: each payment scheme had its own
        **scheme-specific payment processing view** (operational dashboard). A
        payment operator **had to consult multiple systems** during a payment
        investigation or a manual payment repair
      - >
        *Task*: provide a **unified view on payment processing** under different
        payment schemes, allow **enrichment of standard payment messages** with
        customer-specific data while being **compliant with ISO 20022**
      - >
        *Action*: design and implement a **generic relational data model** that
        allows **arbitrary typed connections** between standard payment messages
        including non-standard customer-specific data payloads
      - >
        *Result*: **increased customer satisfaction** with the **unified view on
        payment processing** across multiple payment schemes, the scalable
        **system-wide transaction log**, the **single source of truth** for
        payment operations, real-time payment monitoring, and payment analytics
  - project: Stable FX pricing and execution
    logo: image/logo-santander.png
    auxLogo: image/logo-pagofx.jpg
    STAR:
      - >
        *Situation*: a **cross-border payment service** provides **very
        competitive real-time FX rates** available to a big bank. However, FX
        rates are quite volatile and **change frequently**. *Before the change*:
        a real-time FX rate was provided for an initial quote, then an **updated
        real-time FX rate was silently applied** to the instructed payment which
        was totally unexpected to customers. This quickly transformed into a
        **negative feedback** and an **increased abandonment rate**
      - >
        *Task*: offer **stable FX pricing** to customers for the duration (15
        mins) of their payment journey from the initial quoting and payment
        funding through the beneficiary screening and risk assessment to the
        payment routing and payment execution. The **company absorbed the FX
        loss or gain** due to the volatility of FX pricing
      - >
        *Action*: design and implement a **stable FX pricing for 15 mins** with
        an **explicit notification** of a customer about a **new FX quote**
        after 15 mins if a payment was not yet instructed
      - >
        *Result*: **increased customer satisfaction** and **higher usage of the
        payment service** due to elimination of unexpected changes of FX pricing
        during a payment journey
  - project: Automated digital identity verification
    logo: image/logo-santander.png
    auxLogo: image/logo-pagofx.jpg
    STAR:
      - >
        *Situation*: a **cross-border payment service** provides payment
        services to a big number of **customers in multiple countries** (UK,
        Spain, Belgium). *Before the change*: a **semi-manual process for
        customer onboarding** with manual validation of every new customer. A
        customer onboarding was finished and the **account activated only after
        a manual check** that took 1-2 days. **Periodic check of expired
        customer documents was not feasible** for manual processing given a big
        number of customers
      - >
        *Task*: design a **seamless and fully automated customer onboarding**,
        **automatically collect and verify customer personal data**, enough to
        support AML and fraud checks from the KYC perspective. **Automatically
        build a customer riks profile** and calculate a **customer risk score**.
        Ensure **seamless periodic checks of expired customer documents** to stay
        compliant with regulations
      - >
        *Action*: design and implement **integrations with country-specific
        providers of digital identity verification** (capture of a national ID
        or a driver license, matching a selfie with the ID card, a liveness
        probe) to support a **fully automated instant onboarding of low risk
        customer profiles**
      - >
        *Result*: **increased a lead-to-customer conversion**, **increased
        customer satisfaction**, **decreased abandonment rate** due to a
        **frictionless fully automated instant customer onboarding** through a
        digital identity verification, as well as periodic checks of expired
        customer documents customer personal data
