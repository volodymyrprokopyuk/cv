        <h2>Unified payment data store</h2>
          <ul class="achievements">
            <li>*Situation*: an **instant payments product** connects to **multiple payment schemes** e. g. **SEPA**, **STEP1**, **STEP2**, **RT1**, **TIPS**. *Before the change*: each payment scheme had its own **scheme-specific payment processing view** (operational dashboard). A payment operator **had to consult multiple systems** during a payment investigation or a manual payment repair
</li><li>*Task*: provide a **unified view on payment processing** under different payment schemes, allow **enrichment of standard payment messages** with customer-specific data while being **compliant with ISO 20022**
</li><li>*Action*: design and implement a **generic relational data model** that allows **arbitrary typed connections** between standard payment messages including non-standard customer-specific data payloads
</li><li>*Result*: **improved customer satisfaction** with a **unified view on payment processing** across multiple payment schemes, a scalable **system-wide transaction log**, **single source of truth** for payment operations, real-time payment monitoring, and payment analytics

        <h2>Stable FX pricing and execution</h2>
          <ul class="achievements">
            <li>*Situation*: a **cross-border payment service** provides **very competitive real-time FX rates** available to a big bank. However, FX rates are quite volatile and **change frequently**. *Before the change*: a real-time FX rate was provided for an initial quote, then an **updated real-time FX rate was silently applied** to an instructed payment which was totally unexpected to customers. This quickly transformed into a **negative feedback** and an **increased abandonment rate**
</li><li>*Task*: offer to customers a **stable FX pricing** for the duration (15 mins) of their payment journey from the initial quoting and payment funding through the beneficiary screening and risk assessment to the payment routing and payment execution. The **company absorbed FX loss or gain** due to volatility of FX pricing
</li><li>*Action*: design and implement a **stable FX pricing for 15 mins** with a **notification** of a customer about a **new FX quote** after 15 mins if a payment was not yet instructed
</li><li>*Result*: **improved customer satisfaction** and **higher usage of the payment service** due to elimination of unexpected changes of FX pricing during a payment journey

        <h2>Automated digital identity verification</h2>
          <ul class="achievements">
            <li>*Situation*: a **cross-border payment service** provides payment services to a big number of **customers in multiple countries** (UK, Spain, Belgium). *Before the change*: a **semi-manual process for customer onboarding** with manual validation of every new customer. A customer onboarding was finished and the **account activated only after a manual check**. **Periodic check was not feasible** for manual processing given a big number of customers
</li><li>*Task*: design a **seamless and instant customer onboarding**, **automatically collect and verify customer personal data**, enough to support AML and fraud checks from the KYC perspective. Ensure **seamless periodic checks of customer personal data** to stay compliant with regulations
</li><li>*Action*: design and implement **integrations with country-specific providers of digital identity verification** (capture of a national ID or a driver license, matching a selfie with the ID card, a liveness probe) to support a **fully automated instant onboarding of low risk customer profiles**
</li><li>*Result*: **improved customer satisfaction**, **increased a lead-to-customer conversion**, **decreased abandonment rate** due to a **frictionless fully automated instant customer onboarding** through a digital identity verification as well as periodic checks of customer personal data
