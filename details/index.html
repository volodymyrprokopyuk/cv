</li><li><em>Task</em>: design and implement a <strong>federated IAM solution</strong> that securely manages access of client bank operators and bank systems to applications and APIs of the instant payments product. The IAM solution should support <strong>federated identity management</strong> and provide <strong>fine-grained access control mechanisms</strong> with corresponding <strong>security monitoring and access audit functions</strong> for client bank administrators
</li><li><em>Action</em>: a standard-compliant, reliable, and scalable IAM solution <strong>delegates the initial authentication</strong> of principals to the bank federated identity provider, as well as supports the <strong>adaptive authentication</strong> by requesting additional authentication factors before granting access to sensitive payment information and critical operations. The IAM solution features <strong>dynamic, flexible, and fine-grained PBAC</strong> fully managed by client bank administrators
</li><li><em>Result</em>: the standard-compliant IAM solution provides <strong>secure and compliant access</strong> of client bank operators and bank systems to the instant payment product applications and APIs. The IAM solution directly contributes to <strong>faster time-to-market</strong>, <strong>reduced operational cost</strong>, and <strong>increased customer trust</strong> by seamless integration with the bank-managed federated identity provider and flexible access policies fully controlled by the client bank administrators
